1. Build your Angular App
ng build --prod

2. Create Config file
app.yaml

3. Setting up Google Cloud
- Assuming that you already have a Google account. Go to the Google Cloud Console and login with your Google account.
- Create a new project for your angular app deployment e.g. angular-app-gcp
- In that project, create a Google Storage Bucket. You can search for it in the Search bar provided or just the follow this link.
- Name your bucket something e.g. angular-app-bucket and leave the rest of things as default and click on create.

4. Deploying the Application using Cloud Shell

- Go to the bucket you just created (angular-app-bucket) on the cloud console
- Select the Upload Files option there and upload your dist folder as well your app.yaml file. The folder structure inside your bucket should be as follows:

app.yaml
dist/

- Now, open the Google Cloud Interactive Shell. It is an in-browser terminal window provided by Google for your project

- Once you are connected to the Cloud Shell, Create a directory there for your app e.g. angular-app-gcp
twrkhanasparukh@cloudshell:~ (thenewsroom-mean-app)$  mkdir thenewsroom-angular-app-gcp

- Now you need to sync your data from your bucket into this directory. Use the following command for that:
gsutil rsync -r gs://angular-app-bucket ./angular-app-gcp

For my case:
1.go to folder "thenewsroom-angular-app-gcp" -> cd thenewsroom-angular-app-gcp
2. syncronise the data between the bucket and folder:
twrkhanasparukh@cloudshell:~ (thenewsroom-mean-app)$ gsutil rsync -r gs://thenewsroom-angular-app-bucket ./thenewsroom-angular-app-gcp

- You�re almost done. Now simply deploy your application using the following command:
twrkhanasparukh@cloudshell:~/thenewsroom-angular-app-gcp (thenewsroom-mean-app)$ gcloud app deploy

- You will be asked for the zone/region where you�d like the App Engine to host your application. Select any zone.

- After that, it will take a couple of minutes to deploy your application and will give you link where you can access it.
